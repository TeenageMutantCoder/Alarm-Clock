# Alarm-Clock
Tkinter GUI project for timekeeping

A simple alarm clock GUI project that I worked on to improve coding habits,improve my knowledge of tkinter and pygame modules, and utilize a database. When complete, this will be a fully functioning program similar to the "Clock" app on Android or its iOS equivalent. It has support for a local digital clock, a stopwatch, alarms, and a timer at the moment. Further improvements to the alarms is my next task. I seek to add customizable messages, sounds, and repeat settings.
